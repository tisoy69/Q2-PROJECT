    <p class="recipe-description">Pork Sisig is a sizzling and savory Filipino dish made from chopped and seasoned pork, typically served on a hot plate. It's often enjoyed as an appetizer or as a main course with rice.</p>
    <p class="recipe-description"><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
    <ul class="recipe-description">
      <li>1/2 pound pork face (jowls or cheeks) or pork belly, boiled and grilled, then finely chopped</li>
      <li>1/4 cup pork liver, finely chopped (optional)</li>
      <li>1 small onion, finely chopped</li>
      <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>2-3 red and green chili peppers, finely chopped (adjust to your preferred level of spiciness)</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons calamansi juice (or lemon juice as a substitute)</li>
      <li>1/4 cup mayonnaise</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
      <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
      <li>Cooking oil for grilling and sautéing</li>
      <li>Chopped green onions for garnish</li>
      <li>Fried garlic bits (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="recipe-description"><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>
    <ol class="recipe-description">
      <li>Prepare the pork: Boil the pork face (jowls or cheeks) or pork belly until tender. Once boiled, you can grill or broil the pork until it's nicely charred. After grilling, finely chop the pork into small pieces. If using pork liver, boil and chop it finely as well.</li>
      <li>Sauté the aromatics: In a pan, heat a bit of cooking oil over medium heat. Add the minced garlic and chopped onions. Sauté until the onions become translucent.</li>
      <li>Add the chopped pork: Add the finely chopped grilled pork (and pork liver if using) to the pan. Sauté for a few minutes until the meat is heated through and slightly crispy.</li>
      <li>Season with soy sauce: Pour in the soy sauce and continue to stir the mixture. This adds a rich umami flavor to the dish.</li>
      <li>Add the chili peppers: Toss in the finely chopped red and green chili peppers. You can adjust the amount based on your desired level of spiciness. Sauté for a few more minutes.</li>
      <li>Stir in the mayonnaise: Add the mayonnaise to the pan and mix it thoroughly with the pork and other ingredients. The mayonnaise adds creaminess and balances the heat from the chili peppers.</li>
      <li>Pour calamansi or lemon juice: Squeeze the calamansi or lemon juice into the pan and stir. This citrusy touch adds a tangy flavor that complements the dish.</li>
      <li>Add butter: Toss in the tablespoon of butter and stir until it melts into the mixture. This adds a rich, indulgent flavor.</li>
      <li>Season with salt and pepper: Taste the Pork Sisig and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper to your liking. Remember that soy sauce already adds some saltiness, so be cautious not to over-salt.</li>
      <li>Sizzle on a hot plate: If available, transfer the Pork Sisig to a sizzling hot plate. This adds an exciting sizzle when served.</li>
      <li>Garnish and serve: Garnish your Pork Sisig with chopped green onions and, if desired, fried garlic bits. Serve it hot with steamed rice.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="recipe-description">Pork Sisig is a flavorful and sizzling delight that's perfect for sharing with friends and family. It's a classic Filipino favorite known for its combination of savory, spicy, and citrusy flavors. Enjoy your homemade Pork Sisig!</p>
